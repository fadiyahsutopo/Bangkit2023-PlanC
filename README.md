# About the Project
Tourism is an integral part of the Indonesian economy, contributing significantly to the country's GDP and providing employment opportunities for millions of people. As the number of travelers in Indonesia continues to grow, there is a growing need for innovative solutions that can help tourists plan their trips and make the most of their travel experiences.

This project aims to develop a trip recommendation app to assist people who are struggling to decide on their next trip destination. The app's sophisticated AI algorithm takes into account the user's interests to provide recommendations for the best travel places that users might like to go to. This app also provides a recommendation feature based on images posted by users called FYT (For Your Trip).
